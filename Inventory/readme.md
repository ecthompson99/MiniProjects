This project makes use of classes, dictionaries, lists, for loops, while loops, function calls, inputs, exceptions, and the json library to read and write files.
It stores the names, prices, and descriptions of products the user inputs. The program allows the user to clear inventory, calculate total assets, and see the full list of inventory.

The inventory.json file is used to store inputs from the user. The inventory.py file will pull data from inventory.json upon running.
